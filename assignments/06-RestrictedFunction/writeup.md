# Restricted Function

For this assignment you are to write a function called `restricted_function` in `my_file.py`.
The function should take in no parameters.

If the function is called from its own file, it should print the secret code
in the `SECRET_CODE` global variable. Otherwise, it should print "Access Denied".

You can run `other_file.py` to test your implementation.

Extra credit if you successfully create your restricted function *and* write another
python file called `hack_file.py` to break into your restricted function such that calling
it directly from `hack_file.py` *does* print the secret code.
