# Fast Fibonacci

I have a very elegant solution to the Fibonacci problem in `fib.py`. However,
it is painfully slow. I've taken the liberty of decorating it with `make_fast`, 
but you need to implement that decorator. You can run `runner.py` to verify that
the decorated version is fast enough. 

This problem may be easier if you have taken algorithms. If you have not, 
check out <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization> if you need some 
inspiration. Further Googling is encouraged as always!
