No need to run the submission yourself. Just a visual inspection and analysis. Do you think this would compile? Do you think this would throw runtime errors? Is the code clean, readable, and understandable? Did the student get the spirit of the assignment? Is the solution unique and creative (if applicable)?

I will not prescribe a rubric. Use your best judgement for allocating points. However, I think that a solution that does not compile due to a slight syntax error or a simple misunderstanding of Python but that does get the spirit of the assignment should ballpark in the B range. A solution that technically runs without error but does not get the spirit of the assignment or fails to approach the objective should ballpark C or less. Otherwise solutions should be in the A range. Regardless of the grade, please provide constructive feedback. Compliment creative solutions and provide suggestions for ways to shore up misunderstandings. Be considerate! I will spot check peer reviews for ballpark accuracy, constructiveness, and thoughtfulness.
